				<p>I am a 24 year old user interface designer in Boston. I have been working in the web industry since 2008 and am itching to further my skills.</p>
				<p>I have a passion for:</p>
				<ul>
					<li id="design">Sexy design</li>
					<li id="wp">WordPress</li>
					<li id="beer">Craft beer</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I love sharing my passion for design with others. I've spoken on such topics as <a href="http://choycedesign.com/2012/10/20/design-for-non-designers/">intro design</a>, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/melchoyce/webfonts-demystified">web typography in WordPress</a>, and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/melchoyce/alas-no-mind-meld-designerdeveloper-communication-for-a-harmonious-future">designer-developer communication.</a></p>
				<p>The biggest thing I have missed in my career is a <strong>good mentor</strong>. I have reached an intensely frustrating point in my career, in which I am struggling to grow my skills by myself. I am looking to you guys for an experienced, patient & dedicated mentor to <strong>challenge me daily</strong>.</p>
				<p>I am a great fit for the apprenticeship program -- I have some UI/UX experience already under my belt, but all of my training has been pretty informal. I pick up knowledge and skills as I go along. This program would be a perfect opportunity to fine-tune my skills, working directly with an experienced mentor. I am passionate, enthusiastic, and striving to become the best designer I can. <strong>I believe good design can change the world.</strong></p>
				<p>Below are some recent projects I have been working on:</p>

							<h3>Classics on a Cloud</h3>
							<h4>The Problem</h4>
							<p>As mobile devices, tablets and e-readers are becoming increasingly accessible, libraries are becoming digitized. There is a level of care given to printed books -- from size, to material, to carefully crafted typography -- that is not often found in digital books. Many digital books, especially public domain books, are displayed online with minimal thought to readability and appearance. I wanted to bring carefully designed digital books to an audience growing up increasingly more dependent upon technology: children.</p>
							<h4>The Solution</h4>
							<p>I wanted to bring the same level of care to digital books that many printers bring to printed books. First, I compiled a list of classic children's literature that I wanted to make more accessible to kids. Next, I checked the availability of these books on <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a> and used their text to populate the site.</p>
							<p>I styled the site rather minimally so that the focus was upon the content and illustrations of each book. I used Rooney web, a beautiful serif typeface with a large x-height, and displayed it at a large font size, ample line-height, and short line-length to optimize readability. I'm in the process of adapting the site for different screen sizes.</p>

							<h3>Diner Menu WordPress Theme</h3>
							<h4>The Problem</h4>
							<p>Restaurant websites are often confusing, excessive and flashy (literally!). Many restaurant themes try to give you the whole kitchen sink, when often restaurants do not need so many features. There is a distinct lack of simple themes for restaurant owners, especially owners of small restaurants, diners, and food trucks.</p>
							<h4>The Solution</h4>
							<p>I took a content-first approach when designing Diner Menu. I wanted it to be responsive, minimally styled, and tailored for specifically for smaller eating establishments. It focuses on the important details: when it's open, location, and menu. The site is fully responsive, so it's easy to access on the go and gets you straight to the content you're looking for.</p>
							<p>Please note that in this example, I only designed the theme. <a href="http://redradar.net">Kelly Dwan</a> is doing the development.</p>

							<h3>A Parent's Heart by Ani Tuzman</h3>
							<h4>The Problem</h4>
							<p>Ani Tuzman is a Western MA-based writing instructor who was referred to me for some website help. This past summer, she wanted to expand her primary audience (which was formerly young adults) and delve into a very personal topic: parents of differently abled individuals. She decided to start a website to attract new members for her writing groups, but wanted to start small as she worked on her business model. She wanted help learning how to use WordPress and assistance with creating an attractive and inviting landing page before launching her site (which she wanted to learn to do herself).</p>
							<h4>The Solution</h4>
							<p>I designed a landing page for Ani to rally interest and support before she launches her full site. It has three major focuses:
								<ol>
									<li>A brief introduction to the <em>A Parent's Heart</em> website</li>
									<li>A call-to-action to sign up for her mailing list, which will get you a free eBook of guided writing exercises (which I also designed) and updates on the full site</li>
									<li>Ani's short biography</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p>Ani was especially concerned with the look & feel of the landing page -- she wanted something soft (without being entirely feminine), soothing and inviting. I worked closely with her to establish appropriate aesthetics.</p>
